# TODO

# Thoughts
- Weigh the benefits of storing code in database
- Weigh the benefits of not using webpack through pgfs to bundle code
- Can I still use this package without storing code in the database? How?

- A drawback to dynamic widget loading is having multiple code bundles. There is
the possibility of including a package multiple times. This could be a problem?
Or can it?
