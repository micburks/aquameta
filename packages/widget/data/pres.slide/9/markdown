`widget`
- no longer exists
- ...in the form it previously did
- source urls allow importing/running arbitrary code from the database

But we want

- `jspm.io` for using js ecosystem modules directly
`import React from 'https://dev.jspm.io/react';`
- there are existing frameworks that eschew build steps
