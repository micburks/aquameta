# node-aquameta

`node-aquameta` is a thin server layer for accepting requests and accessing data
- doesn't know implementation details of `datum`
- looks for source urls, looks for data requests, falls back to querying
  endpoint.sitemap (maps url to field)
- returns data with appropriate content-type header
- could perform SSR later
