# source url - the issue

Data access urls are meant to be somewhat readable and RESTful

Human readable urls
- are necessary for resources
- are not necessary for data access
  - no one will ever form these urls by hand

But we're also storing code in the database. When we write code, we need to
reference other pieces of code and this needs to be done in a human-readable
format.

Enter source urls
