`sync` allows bootstrapping code/data from filesystem to database

- does sql dump into a human-readable directory structure
- imports data from this structure into a table
- will watch your files and sync those fields into the database
- we can use existing and familiar tools to edit files and have them imported
  into the database while getting around the shortcoming of the `psql` cli
  interface
- sync makes it easier to develop...
