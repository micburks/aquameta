- many modern libraries, especially frameworks still require build systems
  - e.g. React jsx needs to be transpiled to `React.createElement` function
    calls
- but there are existing frameworks that eschew build steps
  - [`htm`](https://github.com/developit/htm)
    - uses tagged template literals instead of jsx
    - compiles jsx-style strings at runtime to react
  - [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
    - declaratively defines styles as react components
    - inserts styles at runtime
