`node-aquameta` is a small http server for accepting requests and accessing data

- looks for:
  - data fetching urls - format defined in configuration
  - source urls - hardcoded format
  - everything else is assumed to be in the resource table
- does not know:
  - the format of queries
  - how to connect to database
- returns data with appropriate content-type header
- performs SSR
  - due to the limitations of plv8
